        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>I'm Cameron McCleve. My wife and I are from Gilbert AZ and have been married for almost 7 years. We have three kids, 5 and 1 year old daughters, and my son is 3. I am studying Software Engineering and should graduate next year.</p>

            <h2>App Development</h2>
            <p>I also love coding and building apps. Last year I made a goal to build an app. So I built this app called LostDrone using Unity. It is a simple game where you are a drone flying through a cave trying not to hit the spikes. If you hit the spikes you explode. The goal is to get as many points as you can. It was on the Google Play Store but I have taken it down to make some changes. It will hopefully be back on in a few months.</p>

            <h2>Bodybuilding</h2>
            <p>My other passion is bodybuilding/weightlifting! I have been weightlifting for over 8 years now. In October of 2017 I competed in my first "Men's Classic Physique" competition. I lost 44lbs and went from about 26% body fat to only 9%. I am hoping to do another competition this year. </p>
