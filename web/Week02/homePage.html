                <p>I love bodybuilding! In October of 2017 I competed in my first "Men's Classic Physique" competition. I lost 44lbs and went from about 26% body fat to only 9%. </p>

                <p>I also love coding and building apps. Last year I made a goal to build an app. So I built this app called LostDrone using Unity. It is a simple game where you are a drone flying through a cave trying not to hit the spikes. If you hit the spikes you explode. The goal is to get as many points as you can. It is currently on the Google Play store and I am in the proccess of getting it on the Apple App Store.</p>
